This project was the final project for my Data Analysis class.

The goals of this project were to perform data analysis using python toolset and cover the following areas:
 - Data Set Properties
 - Statistic Exploration
 - Data Selection
 - Removing Unwanted data

The steps to be executed to reach each goal were:

Using data file: weather.csv:

1. Data Set Properties
- Find how many rows and columns exist in the data file 
- Display the summary of the data(DataFrame) : Data type per column, memory usage
- Inspect first / last few rows to show how data looks like 

2. Statistic Exploration
- An overview of basic statistics 
- Find minimum PRESSURE
- Find most often measured temperature(TEMP) 
- Plot temperatures
- Plot Histogram (on temperatures)

3. Data Selection, Filtering and Sorting
- Retrieve first 5 rows of TEMP
- Retrieve first TEMP 
- Select Rows 2 and 3 only
- Select Rows 2 and 3 only for TEMP and PRESSURE columns
- Select Rows which have TEMP greater than 6 
- Increase TEMP by 1 for all Rows 
- Sort your data by TEMP

Using data file: athletes.csv:

4. Removing Unwanted data; Removing Outliers
- Produce scatter plot: x='height', y='weight'
- Produce box plot using the height of the athletes
- Remove outliers (for height)
- Produce box plot using the height of the athletes before and after removing the outliers
- Display statistical data sing the height of the athletes before and after removing the outliers
